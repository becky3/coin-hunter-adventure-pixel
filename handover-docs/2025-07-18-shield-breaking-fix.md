# Shield Breaking Animation Fix - 2025-07-18

## Issue
User reported that the shield wasn't blinking during the invulnerability period after breaking, making it unclear how long the invulnerability lasted.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed deltaTime units**: The game loop passes deltaTime in seconds, not milliseconds. Updated ShieldEffect to use seconds for the countdown timer.
2. **Shield now properly blinks for 1 second**: When shield breaks, it enters a "breaking" state with faster blinking (100ms intervals) and is removed after exactly 1 second.
3. **Added damage sound effect**: When shield breaks, both the shield break sound and normal damage sound play together.

## Key Changes
- `src/powerups/ShieldEffect.ts`: 
  - Changed breakingTime from 1000 to 1.0 (seconds)
  - Added breaking state management
  - Added damage sound playback
- `src/effects/ShieldEffect.ts`:
  - Changed blinkSpeed from milliseconds to seconds (0.2 for normal, 0.1 for breaking)
  - Added setBreaking() method to control blink speed

## Testing
- Verified with test-powerup-system.cjs that shield removal timing is correct (1 second)
- Shield visual properly blinks during the breaking period
- Both sound effects play correctly

## Technical Note
The Player entity's invulnerabilityTime is separate from the shield breaking countdown. The player uses milliseconds internally but decreases by `deltaTime * 1000` each frame. The shield effect has its own countdown timer for the visual effect.
